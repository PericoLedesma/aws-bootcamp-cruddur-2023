### Coding the startpoint for the notifications endpoint API

Curretly, the notifications endpoint API was not created.

First, we created the endpoint in the OpenAPI file first with the same structure as homeAPI

We linked with the NotificationActivities class that we created to the openAPI route.

We can see after we linked to the class the route the hardcore results are given by the API.
