# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

What are traces?
Instrumentation

What are we using Honeycomb? To visualice the traces

How are we sending them? Usin opentelemetry

Link what is opentelemetry 



Task: Seting up opentelemetry
Seting up the endpoint in Honeycomb with the api key
Service name: how the data is span

I had in second a trouble problem becuase the was a step that I miss or was not explained and I lost some days strying to fix it. We have to go to the frontend repository and install npm. Because I did not run this step i was stak for a while. I thought the npm was installed with the docker file


Endpoints, each points ahs a service object. Each endpoints is modular and points to a services in the back.

To include tracers in other parts

[https://devpress.csdn.net/python/62f4e4c27e66823466189204.html](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/python/) Acquiring a Tracer 

To create spans, you need to get a Tracer. We just impor the api

from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer("tracer.name.here")

# This is to creating the spans

with tracer.start_as_current_span("mock-data"): # This is the name of the span
        # do something


in HONEYCOMB, library says what did that spans

We have automaticatly some fields on the right part
Some are globnal
We can add some fields for our owns. Next step. Spans because replacement for logs

So next step Adding Attributes to Spans 

Challenge:Instrument the frontend. Is dificult. 
Had our instrumentation. What would we usefull for us
Run custum queries.



# XRAY

we need a daemon to make it work. Another container it seems

Image of best practices

task what is npm? and sdk?

link sdk and aws

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-python.html

https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-python

We add to requirement aws-xray-sdk 

What is middleware for web applications?


We can used middleware layers to handdle steps before the request arrieve to the application, like a security layer. 
We are going to use it for tracing


Task: what is flask



Groups of XRAYS traces: to group traces together


https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-central-1#xray:settings/groups

Next task to create a sampling rule: how much information you want to see. 


https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-central-1#xray:settings/sampling-rules

Now we have to isntall xray daemon

Documentation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html

We are going to put xray tracer in 


Next video: cloudwatch logs 

watchtower library in python to handle cloudwatch logs 

https://pypi.org/project/watchtower/

Task: check all the options in cloudwatch what are

Carefull cloudwatch cost money. Same xray. Not much. We disable it.
