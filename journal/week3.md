__Week Summary__
   * Provision via ClickOps a Amazon Cognito User Pool
   * Install and configure Amplify client-side library for Amazon Cognito
   * Implement API calls to Amazon Cognito for custom login, signup, recovery and forgot password page
   * Show conditional elements and data based on logged in or logged out

__Notes__ 
Need a basic jc tutorial
        
AWS Services used:
* AWS cognito

* [AWS amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/?trk=d3adb855-b91b-4e74-8308-5e9f08e34ed2&sc_channel=ps&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!647302000960!e!!g!!amplify%20aws&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIiLeZuMLR_QIV0dDVCh0m3QCMEAAYASAAEgLMYvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!647302000960!e!!g!!amplify%20aws)

We are using AWS Cognito via CLI.
        AMAZON congnito - user pool -create pool. Just follow instructions. Really clear. Options of recover password and register. 
We have to use AWS amplify library to use aws cognito. Frontend-javascript library 
        We dont need to use it to config cognito, we did it by CLI that is easier.

[AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/)
        
Others: dependencies are libraries that are required to make the application to work

        First step to install aws amplify
        
        
        Note: react app env varibles need to start with REACT_APP
        
        We have to change the status of the user with the aws terminal console 
        
        Users can be created in cognito directly 
        ----
        Backend implementation cognito
        We have to protect our api point, we are passing out token 
        For validating the token
        https://github.com/cgauge/Flask-AWSCognito/blob/master/flask_awscognito/services/token_service.py
        
        We have the authentification client side
        
        We are going to use the library=-- we truy but we reach limitation
        
        access token. we haved to decoded to extract information 
        
        exploring JWT solution for verifu an access toke from cognito and returns claims 
        
        sidecar - 
Sidecar containers are containers that are needed to run alongside the main container. The two containers share resources like pod storage and network interfaces. The sidecar containers can also share storage volumes with the main containers, allowing the main containers to access the data in the sidecars.
