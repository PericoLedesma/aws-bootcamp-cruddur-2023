We are using AWS Cognito via CLI.
        AMAZON congnito - user pool -create pool. Just follow instructions. Really clear. Options of recover password and register. 
We have to use AWS amplify library to use aws cognito. Frontend-javascript library 
        We dont need to use it to config cognito, we did it by CLI that is easier.

[AWS Amplify Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/)
        
Others: dependencies are libraries that are required to make the application to work
