# AWS CLI

There are 2 types to access aws via CLI.
One is installing the aws CLI from you terminal and after providing the secret key and secret access key and the region where you will call the api.

Another way is to use cloudshell from your the aws console.
Note that not all the regions are available for this functionality. Please check the icon close to the name of your IAM User.

# Billing Alerts
There are 2 ways to set the billing alerts.

- Using Budget.
- Using Cloudwatch Alarm. In this case, you need to create an alarm on us-east-1 region (since it is the only region you can create an alarm). You can create up to 10 free cloudwatch alarm

Note: If you are using an IAM user, make sure to attach a billing policy otherwise you won't be able to access this part of the console and you will get an error as you don't have permission.


### Tags
Tags (are Key/Value pair) are useful when you want to know how your cost is allocated. For example, if your want to identify all the services you used under the tag environment: dev (for example)

### Cost Explorer
Cost explorer is a service which visualises, understands and manages your AWS costs usage over time.

### Report
The section report allows for generating reports. there are some reports already created by AWS that you can use

### Credit
This is the section where you submit the credit that you have to obtain during an event (for example after submitting a feedback questionnaire). And also it shows when the expiration date.

### AWS Calculator
This is a tool where you want to estimate the cost of one or more services. Useful when someone asks you to give an estimated cost of the service you are going to use. I used this tool during some exercises on skillbuilder.



## Some Gitpod commands used during the homework

- To create the alarm with the CLI 

>     --account-id $ACCOUNT_ID \
>     --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
>     --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/notifications-with-subscribers.json

Note: Important to have the json files necesarries with the configs



## Billing alarm

First we have to create SNS topic

### Create SNS topic

'''
aws sns create-topic --name my-topic
'''
